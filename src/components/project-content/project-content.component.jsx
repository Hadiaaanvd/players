The station consists of two CNG compressors, two natural gas dryers, six high pressure storage spheres, automated valve panel, two CNG vehicle dispensers, and two credit card readers that may be used by any CNG vehicle owner.",
      "The station was constructed from the ground up by Player and Company, and is currently supplying 10 times the CNG fueling projected by the owner prior to construction. Player and Company placed all the underground electrical conduits, poured all the concrete foundations, and set all equipment for the CNG station. The high pressure stainless steel tubing was installed and pressure tested from the CNG compressors to the storage spheres to the valve panel, and finally, out to the CNG dispensers.",
      "Player and Company electricians pulled all power and controls wiring between the equipment. Terminations were made and the CNG station was placed into service. The CNG station is operating and supplying alternative fuel to vehicles from all over the southeastern United States.",
      "AGL is also building additional CNG stations in Georgia under a CNG Infrastructure Program recently approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission. Player & Company was prime contractor to AGL for the first station completed under this program for the Langdale Company in Valdosta, GA in August 2013",

In order to get this poultry processing plant back up and running as quickly as possible, the left over wiring was spliced back together and temporarily powered up.",
      "Player and Company then went to work on the permanent fix for plant. Six sections of distribution gear were removed beginning on a Friday morning. Six new sections of distribution gear and one new 3,000 amp main breaker were installed in their place. Then the arduous task of terminating hundreds and hundreds of wires commenced.",
      "With crews working around the clock for two full days, the job was completed, tested, and placed back in service within two days. The plant equipment was placed back in service on Sunday. Poultry processing to full plant capacity resumed on Monday morning. When an electrical emergency occurs, who else would you call but Player and Company electricians!",

Player and Company self-performed the entire project to included site work, concrete, equipment setting, piping, power, and controls.",
      "The station consists of a dryer system and five natural gas compressors that take low pressure gas off the pipeline and pump it up to 5,000 pounds per square inch.  This dry, high pressure natural gas may be stored in a 3-pack of horizontal storage vessels for on-demand supply to over 80 slow fill fuel dispensers. The slow fill dispensers allow the brown trucks to add fuel while parked overnight.  The high pressure natural gas may also provide fuel to nine fast fill dispensers. The fast fill dispensers allow trucks to enter the facility, add fuel, and exit the facility in less than 15 minutes.",
      "Player and Company installed all the underground electrical and control conduits for the sprawling compressed natural gas fueling station.  This includes an electrical building with motor control center and safety monitoring system.

The equipment provided for the ethane removal system included an LNG pump, cold box heat exchanger, and flash pressure vessels. The ethane removal system takes liquefied natural gas from a 12 million gallon tank, pumps it through a series of heat exchangers and flash vessels where the ethane is removed; the LNG is then loaded onto 10,000 gallon tankers and taken to be used as a vehicle fuel on trucks by a large delivery company.",

      "The local natural gas utility distribution company had a 24-inch main pipeline valve fail. Player and Company installed the 24” block valve along busy South Deshon Road in Lithonia, Georgia. Pre-job activities consisted of obtaining operator qualification (OQ) certifications for Player and Company personnel, and the creation of shop drawings for fabrication. The shop fabrication was conducted under intense observation by the customer’s inspector. Player and Company qualified pulse-arc and gas metal-arc welding (GMAW) procedures according to API Standard 1104 Welding of Pipelines standards to be utilized for the shop fabrication. Multiple welders were then qualified on the GMAW procedures. All shop welds passed 100% radiographic testing (RT) performed by a third-party testing company.",
      "While the shop fabrication was being conducted, Player and Company cleared and graded the job site on South Deshon Road. The shop fabricated pipe spools were transported to the job site for field installation. The pipe spools were assembled and welded using a shielded metal-arc welding (SMAW) procedure previously qualified to API Standard 1104 Welding of Pipelines standards. Player and Company previously qualified welders for this weld procedure. All field welds passed 100% radiographic testing (RT) performed by a third-party testing company.",
      "The field piping assembly was hydrostatically pressure tested at 1,200 pounds per square inch (psig). The pipe assembly was then sandblasted and coated with the approved underground coating, Spec Polymer SPC-2888. The sandblast profile and underground coating thickness were constantly monitored and logged for the project inspector. Once the underground coating was complete and dry, the pipe assembly was holiday tested for coating defects.",
      "Player and Company excavated the job site to a depth of 10 feet and set the large 24” pipe and valve assembly underground on next to South Deshon Road. The two road crossings, one for the inlet to the 24” valve and one for the outlet, were excavated. This excavation involved closing one lane of South Deshon Road at a time. As the excavation was being accomplished, speed shoring was installed to maintain the integrity of the road so that traffic could continue to safely pass.  The pre-tested and pre-coated inlet and outlet piping were slid underneath the road plates through the excavation while traffic continued to steadily flow on South Deshon Road. Player and Company personnel were protected by shoring as two 24” welds were completed 10 feet below normal grade. The welds were tested radiographically, sandblasted, and coated.",
      "In preparation for the final tie-ins to the existing 24” main, two 24” stopples were installed to interrupt natural gas flow. Shoring was installed around each tie-in and two welding crews cut the section of main out of the way. Two long radius 24” 90 degree elbows were fit to the main and the new piping underneath the road in preparation for welding. The two welding crews welded the tie-ins simultaneously. The four tie-in welds were radiographically tested and the stopples were removed to restore flow to the 24” main. This tie-in work was performed in one day in order to keep the natural gas flow interruption to a minimum.",
      "The final tie-in welds were sandblasted and coated for underground protection. The tie-in pie sections were holiday tested for coating defects, and backfill of the entire job site began. Once the backfill was complete and the road plates removed, the road and site was restored to its original condition. The finishing touches for the project involved installation of a security fence, laying of geotech fabric, and spreading of gravel base. A vehicle access concrete driveway was poured.",
